This is a project that shows an infrastructure built with Docker where it runs:
- a data collection and logs stack
- metrics exposure services
- an EspoCRM instance and its DB

There is a backup script that backs up the database of CRM and docker compose file in a TrueNas instance in the same network.
The script use rsync to estabilish connection between Truenas and mantain only the last three backups.

The containerized infrastructure contains:
- A CRM that users use to work
- A Mariadb database
- Node-Exporter to expose system data to Prometheus
- CAdvisor to expose container data to Prometheus
- Prometheus for collecting metrics from Node-exporter and CAdvidor 
- Promtail for collecting logs from systema directories (in this case it collects docker-related logs, but can also collect many other logs)
- Loki for indexing logs collected by Promtail and makes them queryable
- Grafana that interprets logs provided by loki and creates system dashboards using Prometheus and Node-Exporter
